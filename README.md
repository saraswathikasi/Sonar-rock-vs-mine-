# Sonar-rock-vs-mine-
Here we take a ml model train the model with sonar data and then predict whether it is mine or rock.
We take data and process the data and then split the data to train and test data.(80:20)
Here we take logistic regression model because LR model goes well for the binary classification.
The binary classification is used because we find whether it is rock or mine.
We take help of python programming.
